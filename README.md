### Palette Swap in Julia

This Julia script is designed to swap color palettes between two images. It uses optimal transport theory, specifically the Sinkhorn algorithm, to find an efficient color mapping from the source to the target image. The script allows for customization of the number of colors and the mode of color translation.
